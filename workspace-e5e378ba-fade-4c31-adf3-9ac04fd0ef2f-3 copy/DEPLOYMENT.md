# Render Deployment Guide

This guide will help you deploy the Product Showcase Explorer application on Render.

## üîß **Fixed Configuration**

The deployment issue has been resolved with the following changes:

### Key Fixes Applied:
1. **Updated `render.yaml`** with proper standalone configuration
2. **Modified `next.config.ts`** for production deployment
3. **Updated `package.json`** scripts for standard Next.js deployment
4. **Added image domain configuration** for DummyJSON API

## Prerequisites

1. A Git repository with your code (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket)
2. A Render account (free tier available)

## Step 1: Push Your Code to Git Repository

Make sure all your files are committed and pushed to your Git repository:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fixed Render deployment configuration"
git push origin main
```

## Step 2: Set Up Render Account

1. Go to [Render.com](https://render.com/)
2. Sign up for an account (you can use GitHub for easy authentication)
3. Verify your email address

## Step 3: Create New Web Service

1. Click on "New +" button in the dashboard
2. Select "Web Service"
3. Connect your Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket)
4. Select the repository containing your Product Showcase Explorer code

## Step 4: Configure the Service

### Basic Configuration

- **Name**: `product-showcase-explorer` (or your preferred name)
- **Region**: Choose the region closest to your users
- **Branch**: `main` (or your default branch)

### Build Command
```
npm install && npm run build
```

### Start Command
```
npx next start
```

### Environment Variables
```env
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=10000
```

## Step 5: Advanced Configuration

The `render.yaml` file now includes:
- **Standalone output**: Better deployment compatibility
- **Health check**: `/api/health` endpoint
- **Auto deploy**: Automatic deployment on code changes
- **Proper file includes**: Ensures all necessary files are deployed

## Step 6: Deploy

Click the "Create Web Service" button. Render will:

1. Clone your repository
2. Install dependencies (`npm install`)
3. Build the application (`npm run build`)
4. Start the server (`npx next start`)

## Step 7: Access Your Application

Once deployment is complete, Render will provide you with a URL like:
```
https://product-showcase-explorer.onrender.com
```

Your application will be live and accessible at this URL!

## üîç **Troubleshooting Common Issues**

### **Build Issues**
- **Problem**: `ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/opt/render/project/src/package.json'`
- **Solution**: The `render.yaml` now specifies the correct working directory and build commands

### **Port Issues**
- **Problem**: Application can't bind to port
- **Solution**: PORT environment variable is now set to 10000 (Render's default)

### **Image Loading Issues**
- **Problem**: Product images not loading
- **Solution**: Added `i.dummyjson.com` to allowed image domains in `next.config.ts`

### **TypeScript/ESLint Errors**
- **Problem**: Build fails due to TypeScript or ESLint errors
- **Solution**: Disabled `ignoreBuildErrors` and `ignoreDuringBuilds` for better error handling

## üìä **What's Working Now**

‚úÖ **Fixed Issues:**
- Package.json location detection
- Proper Next.js standalone deployment
- Image domain configuration
- Environment variable setup
- Health check endpoint

‚úÖ **Features Available:**
- Product grid with responsive design
- Advanced filtering and search
- Product detail modals
- Pagination controls
- Smooth animations
- Loading states

## üöÄ **Deployment Success Indicators**

Your deployment is successful when you see:
- ‚úÖ Build completes without errors
- ‚úÖ Service shows "Live" status
- ‚úÖ Health check passes
- ‚úÖ Application loads at the provided URL
- ‚úÖ Products display correctly
- ‚úÖ Search and filters work properly

## üì± **Testing Your Deployed Application**

Once deployed, test these features:
1. **Homepage loads** - Should show product grid
2. **Search functionality** - Try searching for products
3. **Category filters** - Click "Filters" and select categories
4. **Product details** - Click "View Details" on any product
5. **Pagination** - Navigate through pages
6. **Responsive design** - Test on different screen sizes

## üîÑ **Automatic Deploys**

With the updated `render.yaml` configuration, your application will automatically redeploy when you push changes to your repository. This is great for continuous deployment!

## üìû **Support**

If you encounter any issues after applying these fixes:

1. **Check Render logs** for specific error messages
2. **Verify all files are committed** to your repository
3. **Ensure environment variables** are set correctly
4. **Refer to Render documentation** for Next.js deployment
